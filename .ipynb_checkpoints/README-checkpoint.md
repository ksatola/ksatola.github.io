### Latest Papers

- [A Gentle Introduction to Computational Statistics](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/README.md) - There are two perspectives we can look at statistical problems while solving them: _analytical_ and _computational_. In this article, I will walk you through two exemplary problems (simulating outcomes and permutation testing) and compare how they can be solved using both methods.

- [Exploring Countries of the World Dataset](https://github.com/ksatola/Countries-of-the-World/blob/master/BlogPost.md) - The world around us is fascinating and diverse. When I found out about the _Countries of the World_ dataset I decided to take this opportunity to dig deeper inside and answer a few questions which were in my mind.

### Case Studies

- [Bike Share Data](https://github.com/ksatola/Bike-Share-Data) - Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. In this project, the main objective is to use data provided by a bike share system provider to uncover bike share usage patterns.

- [US Airline Delay Statistics](https://github.com/ksatola/US-Airline-Delay-Statistics) - The main objective of the project is to create a data visualization that tells a story to highlight trends and patterns (factors minimizing risks related to delayed or cancelled flights) in a dataset with information on the United States flight delays and performance.
