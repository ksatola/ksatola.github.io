### Latest Papers

- [Effectiveness of Different Analytical Techniques – Statistical and Machine Learning Models – in Particulate Matter Fine Particles Level Forecasting](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/phase01/start.ipynb) - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health in the European Union (EU) causing each year about 400 000 premature deaths, and hundreds of billions of euro in health-related external costs. The goal of this study is to describe efforts and scientific method for comparison effectiveness of different analytical techniques which can be used to predict fine particles of particulate matter (PM2.5) levels (as the most harmful pollutant). The best performing group of algorithms will be used in later iterations to build an interactive tool for PM2.5 level forecasting.

- [A Gentle Introduction to Computational Statistics](https://github.com/ksatola/Computational-Statistics/blob/master/README.md) - There are two perspectives we can look at statistical problems while solving them: _analytical_ and _computational_. In this article, I will walk you through two exemplary problems (simulating outcomes and permutation testing) and compare how they can be solved using both methods.


### Data Products

- [Bike Share Data](https://github.com/ksatola/Bike-Share-Data) (Python Console Apps) - Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. In this project, the main objective is to use data provided by a bike share system provider to uncover bike share usage patterns.

- [US Airline Delay Statistics](https://github.com/ksatola/US-Airline-Delay-Statistics) (Tableau Dashboard) - The main objective of the project is to create a data visualization that tells a story to highlight trends and patterns (factors minimizing risks related to delayed or cancelled flights) in a dataset with information on the United States flight delays and performance.

- [Exploratory Data Analysis of Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/EDA_RedWineQuality_Final.html) - The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to understand better what red wine features may have most impact on red wine good or bad quality ([version with code in R](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/EDA_RedWineQuality_FinalwithCode.html)).

- [Exploring Countries of the World Dataset](https://github.com/ksatola/Countries-of-the-World/blob/master/BlogPost.md) - The world around us is fascinating and diverse. When I found out about the _Countries of the World_ dataset I decided to take this opportunity to dig deeper inside and answer a few questions which were in my mind.

- [WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/wrangle_act.html) - The objectives of this study was performing data wrangling (gathering, assessing and cleaning) on provided thee sources of data, storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data, and finally reporting on 1) [data wrangling efforts](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/wrangle_report.pdf) and 2) [data analyses and visualizations](https://ksatola.github.io/projects/wrangle_preso.pdf) (as separate documents).
